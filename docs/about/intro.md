## What is Royale?

Royale is a first-of-its-kind decentralized protocol for directing optimized stablecoin liquidity pools toward Web 3.0 “smart-backed” funding solutions for [iGaming](igaming) products.

Royale's mission is to use DeFi protocol innovations to kickstart iGaming businesses. We aim to create an optimized decentralized liquidity network that pushes the limits of innovation and lowers the barriers of entry for the iGaming industry.

By injecting the unprecedented trust and financial innovation of decentralized finance (DeFi) into the iGaming industry, we will create an entirely new crypto niche we call [*iGDeFi*](iGDeFi). Using the Royale platform, iGaming startups can bootstrap the acceptance of Provably Fair on-chain technology as well as their own bankroll facilities by leveraging our iGDeFi tech stack. 

The relationship between cryptocurrency and online betting has long been close. However, those ties have mostly been focused on only one of the many features that cryptocurrency offers * payment. While many crypto projects have come and gone that have used blockchain as a means of payment or source of authentically random numbers, we have yet to see one that employs our approach of applying decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools to business development (BD) financing for iGaming platforms.

## How Does Royale Work?

Royale is a cross-chain DeFi solution for the iGaming industry. Our user-centric platform creates Web 3.0 smart-backed liquidity that allows iGaming entrepreneurs to bootstrap innovation with the security and transparency of the blockchain.

The Royale vision is to emphasize product design that drives adoption of verifiably genuine products with a simple user experience and user interface (UXUI). The Royale ecosystem seeks to fuel automated, validated, verifiable iGaming products that cater to both new and experienced users.

Royale is a three-sided network platform that consists of:

1) stablecoin (USDC, USDT, DAI) liquidity providers,

2) iGaming entrepreneurs seeking a liquidity backstop, and

3) stakers of the ROYA token.

A robust cryptoeconomic system incentivizes both iGaming entrepreneurs and liquidity providers to become long-term ecosystem participants. Therefore, Royale hopes to be able to consistently draw value from external sources over time. The differentiation between Royale and other DeFi projects is that the value flows in the Royale ecosystem should be largely uncorrelated to other value flows present in the DeFi industry. Thus, the countercyclical nature of the Royale ecosystem should make it an attractive venue for the contribution of decentralized stablecoin liquidity.

While the iGaming industry is familiar with cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, the exponential effects brought by well-engineered token-based value capture mechanisms have yet to impact this fast-growing industry. Royale platform users do not necessarily have to be gamers. They merely have to be active stablecoin liquidity providers willing to contribute to the success of innovative iGaming platforms. Royale Finance embraces a wide variety of community members.
