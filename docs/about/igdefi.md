## iGaming + DeFi = iGDeFi

While DeFi has taken the blockchain world by storm in 2020, it has largely remained within the comfy confines of the largely isolated crypto echo chamber. Royale believes that it is the right time to explore the application of DeFi thinking and decentralized procedures to particular industry niches.

The Royale team have been actively engaged with the industry since 2014 and DeFi enthusiasts since 2018, back when most of the industry referred to the concept as Open Finance. They are also serial entrepreneurs, having spawned or supported multiple startups and crypto projects around the world.

Our goal on the DeFi side will be to drive liquidity into the protocol via continuous integrations with quality high-level protocols so that our liquidity providers feel safe, secure and protected from notorious DeFi bogeymen like liquidation and impermanent loss. The monolithic Royale liquidity pool will serve as a staging area for stablecoins that are waiting to be deployed into iGaming opportunities. In order to maximize the potential of these stablecoins, Royale strategies will be used to ensure optimum capital efficiency.

On the iGaming side,

The following principles guide development:

- DeFi will become a trillion-dollar market fueled by the rise of stablecoins and new scalable cross-chain base layer blockchain networks.
- iGaming is a fast-growing $100 billion industry.
- Despite the recent hype, DeFi user penetration is currently just 1% of global crypto users, thus providing a massive runway for future growth.
- Many DeFi pain points remain, among which are excessive gas fees, poor user experience, and a limited understanding of smart contracts
- Most current DeFi users are primarily motivated by a desire to maximize risk-adjusted yield via liquidity mining with stablecoin assets
- Bringing the iGaming and DeFi ecosystems together to fuel adoption in the spaces we love offers a unique value proposition we call iGDeFi

Royale aims to drive continued adoption of iGaming products with a hybrid approach secured by blockchain technology, innovated by DeFi, and amplified by a community bound together by the ROYA governance token.
