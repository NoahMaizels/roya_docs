## Community First

As the world begins to embrace the decentralized and open-source Web 3.0 of the future, entrepreneurs are beginning to understand the importance of community in building their vision. One overreaching and vital element of bitcoin and blockchain's success is the community of early adopters who rallied around its cause. The value of bitcoin, or pretty much any other cryptocurrency for that matter, is not derived from the cold, hard technology it is based on. Rather, it is the combined efforts of the whole community of ecosystem participants - entrepreneurs, liquidity contributors and community members alike - that define the future potential for that technology.

In contrast, the old Web 2.0 networks that have driven the Nasdaq to such dizzying heights are so profitable because they leverage network effects for the sole benefit of the corporation and its shareholders. These companies then grow at exponential rates for extended periods of time. The community that brings the lion's share of the value to the network are left out in the cold.

In the grand growing tradition of DeFi entities, Royale intends to bestow upon its community a meaningful portion of the network that they actively create, maintain, and grow. After all, those users are people, not just data, and those people comprise the Kings and Queens of Royale. The ROYA token itself serves as a rallying point to coordinate the community's collective action towards our common goal of transforming the iGaming industry for the better.

Royale features are built for the community. Our monolothic stablecoin liquidity pool maximizes the opportunity for up-and-coming iGaming concepts to gain traction, lowering the barriers to entry in this fast-moving industry. Blockchain technology and on-chain transaction verification of Royale iGaming investments emphasize transparency, allowing the community to see for themselves the actions we take with our liquidity pool. Lastly, our emphasis on provably fair technology tilts the space away from the entrenched interests that now dominate iGaming and back to our own community-driven ecosystem.

Our long-term goal is for the three Royale ecosystem participants - stablecoin liquidity providers, ROYA stakers, and iGaming entrepreneurs - to become one interwoven, impenetrable force. The entrepreneurs become a part of the community and the community becomes entrepreneurs. The liquidity providers become gamers and, vice versa, gamers become liquidity providers. Our robust community-first tokenomic model should incentivize behavior that encourages the development of products of value and experiences that matter.


## Business Philosophy

At its core, Royale will be a two-sided network platform composed of liquidity suppliers and liquidity users. The ROYA token and its community represents a third side that coordinates and weaves itself throughout the platform. While there will be many advantages for iGaming entrepreneurs to access liquidity from and participate in the Royale ecosystem, there will also be cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage liquidity providers to become long-term ROYA token holders. All network participants would benefit from iGaming revenue streams, as portions of these value streams will be distributed throughout the Royale ecosystem according to the governance mechanisms established by ROYA token holders. As the ecosystem builds momentum, it should attract more liquidity, more entrepreneurs and more ROYA token holders.

ROYA token holders will therefore have the opportunity to participate in a network that captures significant value from non-crypto sources. Royale aims to expand the application of cryptoeconomics by targeting a growing niche of the fintech industry that has so far escaped the influence of cryptoeconomic systems. The iGaming industry is no stranger to cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, but the exponential effects wrought by well-engineered token-based value capture mechanisms have yet to have their impact felt in this growing industry. Users of the Royale platform would not necessarily be gamers, they would be liquidity providers for gaming platforms.

The team has the experience in the domain to collectively deliver the initiative. The founders, early period management team (before the transition to a DAO structure), and lead developers have all worked and built products and services within the crypto, trading, international business, e-sports and gaming industries. They now seek to combine their skillset to build a scalable, robust blockchain-based cryptoeconomic network that can service the iGaming industry by creating the next generation of provably fair games.

The Royale vision drives our product design, which we hope will drive user adoption through verifiably genuine products that have simplified UX/UI that is especially appropriate for the cross-section of players that we believe are attracted to both iGaming and DeFi. The Royale ecosystem will aim to support products that are automated, validated, verified and cater to both new and experienced users

## Business Development

Royale seeks first clients seeking to access their unique blend of blockchain-based services. This business development success has uniquely positioned Royale to support other emerging projects building provably fair games that require bankroll facilities. We estimate that potential market to be quite large.

With the current exponential growth rate of iGaming and DeFi products, we believe that simplifying access to the &quot;House's Edge&quot; could transform the equation for entrepreneurs looking to enter the global iGaming industry precisely at a time when this industry stands at an inflection point. Finally, regulators all over the world are amenable to online games of chance. The pandemic has pushed people to spend more time on the internet than ever before. And the world is awash with excess value to not only invest but also to play with.

iGaming companies are on-boarded subject to Royale's terms and conditions, which are set forth by the governing council, conditions such as independent audits, pen testing and access to the iGamings admin panel during the course of the loan.

We want every online casino to plug into our suite of provably fair games sponsored by our platform participants.


## Tracking progress

Royales critical success factors will be monitored by a multitude of tracking progress systems specifically chosen to measure and maximize performance across all areas of the ecosystem.. By monitoring key protocol operations and outcomes, we will gain new perspectives of the ecosystem, including our strengths and vulnerabilities, our evolution over time, and the ways in which we can drive the network forward.

Success criteria that we will base the project on will be predominantly focused on the number of network participants which includes businesses that require the services offered, token holders we add to the ecosystem, and retain and also the monthly recurring revenue metrics we track will determine what is working and what needs to be changed to enhance the decentralized economy's profitability.

**MRR:** Monthly recurring revenue will be a key performance metric at. It gives us the ability to assess game performance alongside bankroll management and determine ways to increase this whilst limiting a drop in recurring revenue streams, and simultaneously researching and developing new ones.

**Network churn Rate:** The churn rate of our network participants is another important key metric that we will be monitoring as this gives us the ability to take action and limit the rate at which we might be losing community members, ways to mitigate the churn rate will be implemented as we collect data as the network grows, communication with network participants will always be at the forefront of keeping our networks satisfaction levels high.

**Network Lifetime Value:** The purpose of the network lifetime value metric is to assess the financial value of each member of the community. Tactics such as better content to accompany the user journey. Specific and personalized content that is relevant to our clients.

With the use of machine learning and data analytics we will intelligently harness data to orchestrate relevant and individualized marketing content to create a positive user and client journey, that is not only profitable but is also an educational journey on how to improve their user experience.

**Network Participant Acquisition Cost:** The cost of acquiring network participants is a key metric for our DAO's model and a dedicated team that focuses on A/B testing to enhance conversion rates will be implemented as soon as we launch the protocol and begin an aggressive marketing campaign.
